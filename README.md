# CS-250: Agile Software Development - Crafting User-Centric Solutions

Welcome to my CS-250 repository, an in-depth exploration of Agile methodologies and Scrum practices through a project for the fictional web company, "SNHU Travel."

- **Product Owner**: Conducted market research and developed user stories that directly influenced the project's features.
- **Development/Testing Team Member**: Engaged in coding, debugging, and testing to create a high-quality end product.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Insights

- **Final Product**: Contained within the .jar files, you can explore the full capabilities of the completed project.

## ðŸ“Œ Learning Outcomes

1. **User Experience Design**: Mastered the art of interpreting user needs and weaving them into a robust and appealing final product.
2. **Interface Design**: Ensured a seamless, user-friendly interface, recognizing that user interaction is as vital as the underlying code.
