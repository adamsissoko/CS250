### CS-250: Agile Methodologies in Software Development - A Case Study in Practical Application

#### Introduction

Welcome to this repository, which presents a comprehensive case study of the Agile Software Development lifecycle, focusing on Scrum methodologies. Over a demanding six-week sprint cycle, I performed various roles—Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Developer/Tester—in a project for a hypothetical client, "SNHU Travel." This multi-role experience provided me with a 360-degree view of Agile principles in action.

#### Project Overview

This project served as a crucible for mastering Agile and Scrum fundamentals in a simulated real-world environment. Roles alternated to offer a complete experience, from sprint planning to market research and from code development to product testing.

##### Roles and Contributions

- **Scrum Master**: Orchestrated sprint ceremonies and enforced Agile protocols to optimize workflow.
- **Product Owner**: Undertook comprehensive market analysis to develop insightful user stories, shaping the project's feature set.
- **Developer and Tester**: Spearheaded the development phase, focusing on robust coding practices, debugging, and meticulous quality assurance testing.

#### Documentation and Deliverables

An exhaustive Sprint Retrospective document available in this repository provides a summary, insights, and analyses concerning each sprint cycle and the project as a whole. Additionally, the repository contains .jar files illustrating the final product's capabilities.

#### Skill Development and Key Learnings

1. **User-Centric Design**: Cultivated an expertise in interpreting and translating user needs into actionable development tasks, resulting in an exceptionally user-friendly final product.
2. **User Interface Excellence**: Prioritized a seamless and intuitive user interface, acknowledging that user satisfaction extends beyond back-end functionality to front-end experience.
3. **Team Dynamics and Communication**: Acquired and applied effective communication skills in a diverse, team-oriented environment, emphasizing transparent, constructive dialogues.
